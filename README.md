# Iron Maiden Lyrics Analysis

This project analyzes Iron Maiden's lyrics using various natural language processing (NLP) techniques. This was my final project for my first Natural Language Processing as part of my Cognitive Science studies and its goal is to uncover patterns, sentiments, and thematic elements in the band's discography.

## Project Overview

The analysis consists of several key components:

- **Data Collection & Cleaning:**  
  The raw lyrics data was preprocessed by removing stop words, punctuation, and performing tokenization to prepare it for further analysis.

- **Sentiment Analysis:**  
  Evaluated the emotional tone of the lyrics by assigning sentiment scores. This helps in understanding the overall mood and how it evolves over different albums and time periods.

- **Topic Modeling:**  
  Applied topic modeling techniques (LDA) to identify recurring themes and subjects in the lyrics. This uncovers hidden patterns in the textual data.
